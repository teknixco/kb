static
The static keyword defines a static method or property for a class. Neither static methods nor static properties can be called on instances of the class. Instead, they're called on the class itself.

Static methods are often utility functions, such as functions to create or clone objects, whereas static properties are useful for caches, fixed-configuration, or any other data you don't need to be replicated across instances.

class ClassWithStaticMethod {

  static staticProperty = 'someValue';
  static staticMethod() {
    return 'static method has been called.';
  }

}

console.log(ClassWithStaticMethod.staticProperty);
// output: "someValue"
console.log(ClassWithStaticMethod.staticMethod());
// output: "static method has been called."


 class Example {
   static staticVariable = 'GeeksforGeeks';
    
  //static variable defined
   static staticMethod() {
     return 'static method has been called.';
      }
  }
  // static variable called
  console.log(Example.staticVariable);
  // static method called
  console.log(Example.staticMethod());
